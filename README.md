# Lab 16: Spring Auth

## Feature Tasks
Build an app that allows users to create their profile on CodeFellowship.

The site should have a splash page at the root route (/) that contains basic information about the site, as well as a link to the “sign up” page.
- An ApplicationUser should have a username, password ( hashed using BCrypt), firstName, lastName, dateOfBirth, bio, and any other fields you think are useful.
- The site should allow users to create an ApplicationUser on the “sign up” page.
- Your Controller should have an @Autowired private PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder; and use that to run passwordEncoder.encode(password) before saving the password into the new user.
- The site should have a page which allows viewing the data about a single ApplicationUser, at a route like /users/{id}.
- This should include a default profile picture, which is the same for every user, and their basic information.
- Using the above cheat sheet, add the ability for users to log in to your app.
- Upon logging in, users should be taken to a /myprofile route that displays their information.
- Ensure that user registration also logs users into your app automatically.
- The site should be reasonably styled. (This can be using CSS that you did not create yourself.)
- The site should contain integration testing. At a minimum, there should be tests to ensure basic functionality for the splash page and the sign up page.


Allow users to log in to CodeFellowship and create posts.
- Using the above cheat sheet, add the ability for users to log in to your app.
- Upon logging in, users should be taken to a /myprofile route that displays their information.
- Ensure that your homepage, login, and registration routes are accessible to non-logged in users. All other routes should be limited to logged-in users.
- Ensure that user registration also logs users into your app automatically.
- Add a Post entity to your app.
- A Post has a body and a createdAt timestamp.
- A logged-in user should be able to create a Post, and a post should belong to the user that created it.
- hint: this is a relationship between two pieces of data
- A user’s posts should be visible on their profile page.
- When a user is logged in, the app should display the user’s username on every page (probably in the heading).
